# hashup

> [!TIP]
> Mainly to use in conjunction with [kirby-hashed-assets](https://github.com/johannschopplich/kirby-hashed-assets).

`hashup` is a tiny CLI tool with two objectives in mind for your freshly built frontend assets:

1. Rename or rather hash (hence the name) the assets.
2. Generate a `manifest.json` for them.

## Installation

If you want to use hashup right away, there is no need to install it. Simply call it with `npx`:

```bash
npx -y hashup
```

Otherwise, add it to your development dependencies with either `npm`, `pnpm` or your package manager of choice:

```bash
# pnpm
pnpm add -D hashup

# npm
npm i -D hashup
```

## Usage

Add hashup to your build pipeline by adding it your `package.json` scripts (recommended), for example:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "clean": "rm -rf public/assets/{css,js}",
    "build": "npm run clean && <...> && hashup"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "hashup": "latest"
  }
}
```

Now, pass asset paths to Kirby's asset helpers like you normally do:

```php
<?= js('assets/js/main.js') ?>
// `<script src="https://example.com/assets/js/main.9ad649fd.js"></script>
```
